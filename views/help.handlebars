                <h1 style="color:#000">How to use Crescendo</h1>
                <p style="color:#5e5e5e">Crescendo is an app that allows you to assess the noise level of the many environments you find yourself in, keep track of all your sound equipment, and provides links to popular sites that are well known for their information about sound equipment. All of this functionality can be accessed from the home page, or through the use of the navigation bar. To learn more about a particular feature, simply continue below.</p>
                <h3 style="color:#000" id="soundtest">Testing your environment</h3>
                <p style="color:#5e5e5e">Testing the noise in your environment is made easy with Crescendo. In order to do so, tap either the <b><em>Sound Test</em></b> button on the navigation bar or the <b><em>Start Sound Test</em></b> button on the home page. From there the Sound Test page will load which contains two important parts: the environment selector and the <b><em>Test Noise Level</em></b> button. With the environment selector, you are informing Crescendo that you are either testing a new environment or retesting an old one. Once you choose the environment, tap the <b><em>Test Noise Level</em></b> button in order to begin the test. Your browser will request permission to access your device's microphone. Once you allow access, the test will begin. Crescendo will detect sound for 7.5 seconds and then it will display whether or not you should consider wearing headphones or using a less sensitive microphone. At this point, the <b><em>Save to Environment</em></b> button will appear and you can then save your results to your chosen environment. If you start a test and change your mind, you can cancel the test and no analysis will be done.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color:#000" id="environment">Keeping track of your environments</h3>
                <p style="color:#5e5e5e">In time you will want to assess the noise level of a number of environments, and you are going to need a way to keep track of them all. Crescendo allows you to add new environments, edit them, and delete them. To start managing your environments, tap either the <b><em>My Environments</em></b> button on the navigation bar or the <b><em>View Environments</em></b> on the home page. On the My Environments page, the list of your environments will appear. Tapping on an environment listing will reveal your equipment that you chose for that environment along with the edit button which looks like so:</p><div style="color:#000;text-align:center"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-2x whiteicon"></i>EDIT ENVIRONMENT</div><p style="color:#5e5e5e">Tapping the edit button brings you to the Edit Environment page that allows you to rename the environment, change its location type, change the gear you use in the environment, change its sound level value, and delete it. At the bottom of the list of environments is the add environment button which looks like so:</p><div style="text-align:center"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-2x whiteicon"></i></div>
                
                <h3 style="color:#000" id="equipment">Your equipment</h3>
                <p style="color:#5e5e5e">Managing your equipment is similar to managing your environments. To start managing your environments, tap either the <b><em>My Equipment</em></b> button on the navigation bar or the <b><em>View Equipment</em></b> on the home page. On the My Equipment page, the list of your Equipment will appear. Tapping on an equipment listing will reveal your environments that you use the equipment in along with the edit button which looks like so:</p><div style="color:#000;text-align:center"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-2x whiteicon"></i>EDIT EQUIPMENT</div><p style="color:#5e5e5e">Tapping the edit button brings you to the Edit Environment page that allows you to rename the equipment, change its type, specify its usage, and delete it. At the bottom of the list of equipment is the add equipment button which looks like so:</p><div style="text-align:center"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-2x whiteicon"></i></div>
                
                <h3 style="color:#000" id="community">Audio help beyond Crescendo</h3>
                <p style="color:#5e5e5e">There are many resources out there that can give you audio equipment advice alongside Crescendo. The Community page contains links to many of these different resources. However, these websites are not affiliated with Crescendo so a pop-up appears asking you if you are sure you want to leave Crescendo to go to these other websites. The community page can be navigated to by clicking the <b><em>Community</em></b> button on the navigation bar or the <b><em>Go to Community page</em></b> on the home page.</p>
